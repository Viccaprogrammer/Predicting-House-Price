However, previous studies have not made comprehensive evaluation of how deprivation can impact house in other areas. The study utilized 6 major machine learning model such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, Neutral Network and considered K-means Clustering. The dataset used was collected from the Office for National Statistics and the Department for Communities and Local Governments, which comprises of the median house price dataset and English indices of deprivation 2015 respectively. The experimental result derived shows that Random Forest and Neural Network are suitable for predicting the median house price.
